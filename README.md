# 2048 in Scala [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dubzzz/scala-2048.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dubzzz/scala-2048)[![Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/assets/badges/scalajs-0.6.17.svg)](https://www.scala-js.org)

Writing a 2048 game is only a pretext to try using Scala and its ecosystem on a project.

Immutability, functional programing, ScalaCheck, streams are among the topics I will try to discover through this simple project.
